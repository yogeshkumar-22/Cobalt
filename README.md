Frontend: React, TypeScript  
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript  
Database: SQLite / MongoDB / LowDB

# ðŸ§  Architectural Overview
  OAuth Flow  
    User clicks "Connect to Slack".  
    Redirects to Slack OAuth page.  
    On success, Slack returns an access token and refresh token.  
    Tokens are securely stored in the backend.  

Token Management  
    Access tokens are stored with expiry time.  
    When expired, backend uses refresh token to get a new access token.  
    This ensures seamless user experience without re-authentication.  

Message Scheduling  
    Messages are stored with timestamp and channel info.  
    checks for due messages and sends them via Slack API.
